            <p class="section-title">Copyright and Responsibility</p>
            <p>Any work done by Shunno Software for any client, which includes the scripts, coding or software, unless
                mutually agreed, will be the copyright of Shunno Software and should not be commercially reproduced or
                resold without the information and authorization of Shunno Software.</p>
            <p>Shunno Software cannot be held responsible for copyright violations caused by materials and content
                submitted by the Client/Customer. Shunno Software will not be responsible for costs incurred,
                recompense, or loss of earnings due to the failure to meet arranged deadlines. Shunno Software will not
                be liable for the nonexecution of the project for certain reasons not in control of Shunno Software.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Website and Content</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted at law, Shunno Software provides this website and its contents on an "as
                is" basis and we make no warranties until a client enters into an agreement with us on a pay-for-service
                basis. Then the agreement of the service will determine the nature of representations and warranty.</p>
            <p>Shunno Software seeks to ensure that all material on this site is accurate and up-to-date. However,
                Shunno Software is not liable for the content of any outside websites which may be linked to from our
                site.</p>
            <p>The following terms and conditions will apply to general Website Development & Software Services offered
                by Shunno Software. By ordering services from Shunno Software you are agreeing to the following terms
                and conditions.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to refuse to build a website which we may judge as unfit due to content or
                otherwise. This includes, but is not restricted to, sites containing adult-oriented material such as
                pornography, sites which promote hatred towards persons belonging to any ethnic group, religion, or
                orientation, and sites which infringe copyright.</p>
            <p>In Website & Software, all material, both text and images, supplied by the client and used in the
                construction, will remain the client's property. All such material will be assumed to be the property of
                the client and free to use without fear of breach of copyright laws.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Backups and Data Management</p>
            <p>Your use of this service is at your sole risk. Our backup service runs once a week/daily, overwrites any
                of our previous backups made, and only one week of backups are kept. Each user is solely responsible for
                all installation, maintenance, security, and backup of the operating system, software, files, and data
                used in the user's container, as well as any reinstalls and changes. This service is provided to you as
                a courtesy. Shunno Software is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree
                to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backups of
                files and data stored on Shunno Software servers. For its own operational efficiencies and purposes,
                Shunno Software from time to time backs up data on its servers, but is under no obligation or duty to
                the subscriber to do so under these terms. It is solely the subscriber's duty and responsibility to back
                up the subscriber's files and data on Shunno Software servers, and under no circumstance will Shunno
                Software be liable to anyone for damages of any kind under any legal theory for loss of subscriber files
                or data on any Shunno Software server.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Investigation of Violations</p>
            <p>Shunno Software may investigate any reported or suspected violation of this Agreement, its policies, or
                any complaints and take any action that it deems appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances to
                protect its systems, facilities, customers, and/or third parties. Shunno Software will not access or
                review the contents of any e-mail or similar stored electronic communications except as required or
                permitted by applicable law or legal process.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Actions to Violations</p>
            <p>Shunno Software reserves the right and has absolute discretion to restrict or remove from its servers any
                content that violates this Agreement or related policies or guidelines, or is otherwise objectionable or
                potentially infringing on any third party's rights or potentially in violation of any laws. If we become
                aware of any possible violation by you of this Agreement, any related policies or guidelines, third
                party rights, or laws, Shunno Software may immediately take corrective action, including, but not
                limited to, (a) issuing warnings, (b) suspending or terminating the Service, (c) restricting or
                prohibiting any and all uses of content hosted on Shunno Software systems, and/or (d) disabling or
                removing any hypertext links to third party websites, any of your content distributed or made available
                for distribution via the Services, or other content not supplied by Shunno Software which, in Shunno
                Software's sole discretion, may violate or infringe any law or third-party rights or which otherwise
                exposes or potentially exposes Shunno Software to civil or criminal liability or public ridicule. It is
                Shunno Software's policy to terminate repeat infringers. Shunno Software's right to take corrective
                action, however, does not obligate us to monitor or exert editorial control over the information made
                available for distribution via the Services. If Shunno Software takes corrective action due to such
                possible violation, Shunno Software shall not be obligated to refund to you any fees paid in advance of
                such corrective action.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Revelation Rights</p>
            <p>To comply with applicable laws and lawful governmental requests, to protect Shunno Software systems and
                customers, or to ensure the integrity and operation of Shunno Software's business and systems, Shunno
                Software may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or appropriate, including,
                without limitation, user profile information (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.), IP addressing and
                traffic information, usage history, and content residing on Shunno Software servers and systems. Shunno
                Software also reserves the right to report any activity that it suspects violates any law or regulation
                to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Warranty Disclaimer: Maintenance</p>
            <p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that Shunno Software reserves the right to temporarily suspend services
                for the purposes of maintaining, repairing, or upgrading its systems and network. Shunno Software will
                use best efforts to notify you of pending maintenance; however, at no time is Shunno Software under any
                obligation to inform you of such maintenance.</p>
